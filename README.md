Welcome to our comprehensive resource on The Red Lake weapon statistics.

The Red Lake is a Roblox PvE game where players must fend off waves of zombies using an array of unique weapons and operatives, each with their own specialties.

Inspired by our passion for programming, The Red Lake and the enthusiasm it generated during its early days, we embarked on creating an advanced weapon calculator in April 2024. This tool leverages a meticulously compiled weapon sheet, enabling us to calculate and present detailed statistics for every weapon available in the game. Our goal is to provide players and enthusiasts with a reliable resource that enhances gameplay strategy and overall enjoyment.
