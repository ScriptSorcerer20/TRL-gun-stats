    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3><b>Hey there!</b> You seem to have stumbled upon the TRL Stat Page created by <b>Fretux</b> and

    </p>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p class="about_us_text">
        In the beginning, the only way to calculate DPS/DPM stats for certain operatives was, by using the Spreadsheet
        by Lanz1021 and a calculator, which quickly turned out to be (shockers) really annoying. TRL Stats started out
        as a side project, initially started by Losernoob124 to calculate gun stats more easily, but given up one after
        a couple of weeks. Eventually Fretux started working on it again and what initially was just a fun hobby grew
        into something much bigger, and through the help of Stack Overflow and many hours of programming, we
        turned it into a full-fledged website.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p class="about_us_text"><b>How do you calculate DPS and DPM?</b></p>
    <p class="about_us_text">We put the data given by
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hGGLMOKB5Tj3FSo38HX7WbIvOmMbgfE5ZApTSOZgnS8/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Lanz1021's
            Stat Sheet</a> into a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp">.JSON (Javascript Object
            Notation)</a> file, which we use to calculate the DPS
        (damage per second) and DPM (damage per minute) of each weapon via a formula that is also mentioned on Lanz1021'
        Spreadsheet.</p>

    <p class="about_us_text"><b>How often are stats updated?</b></p>
    <p class="about_us_text">We update the weapon stats every time a new update is released for TRL.</p>
